## How to build

This ASKmod is based on a [Black & Decker tool roll](https://askotec.openculture.agency/product/blackdecker-tool-set/) with the following modifications:

We added a [garden wire](https://askotec.openculture.agency/product/garden-wire/) to the set and the pocket where the attachments for the ratchet we made a little smaller with a stapler so that the attachments do not fly around. Here you will find [detailed instructions](https://github.com/opencultureagency/ASKmod-Mechanical-Tool-Set/blob/main/manual.md).
